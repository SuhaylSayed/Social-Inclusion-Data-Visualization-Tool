# About the Social Inclusion project
The Social Inclusion project is linked to Canadaâ€™s Anti-Racism Strategy and the Centre for Gender, Diversity and Inclusion.  This project aims to bring together key statistical information on the inclusion (or exclusion) of ethnocultural groups and immigrants in Canada.

This one-stop data tool introduces a framework to organize and access data on social inclusion for ethnocultural groups and immigrants in Canada and responds to an increased demand for statistical indicators to support evidence-based decision-making aimed at building a more equitable and inclusive society.

The social inclusion indicators used in this tool are categorized into 11 themes relevant to the analysis of social inclusion. They are drawn from a variety of data sources, including the Census of Population, social and health surveys, and other administrative databases produced at Statistics Canada.

# About the Data Visualization Tool 
The data visualization tool is an RShiny application that generates interactive visualizations using disaggregated demographic data. The data visualization tool lets users customize charts to view the number or percentage of a variety of social inclusion indicators for five categories: 1) groups designated as visible minorities, 2) visible minority by immigration status, 3) sex/gender, 4) geography, and 5) time series analysis. Users can select a category from the tabs at the top of the tool.

The number of sociodemographic characteristics in each tab and dropdown menu varies from one indicator to another. The social inclusion indicators are drawn from a variety of data sources, including the Canadian censuses of population, social surveys, and other administrative databases produced at Statistics Canada. As a result, some databases offer greater flexibility for analysis purposes, while the level of disaggregation in others is more limited.
